                <h2>Portfolio Design Rationale</h2>
                <p>
                    This website was created for my Foundations of User Experience course,
                    taken during my sophomore year at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.
                    <mark>
                        The purpose of creating this portfolio is the showcase my design
                        skills to future potential employers.
                    </mark>
                    Therefore, while creating the webpage I had to think about how my
                    primary audience would be human resource professionals or engineers
                    who are looking to hire an engineer, and had to make design choices
                    accordingly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One choice I made about the website was to 
                    <mark>
                        make clear distinctions between each section within the page.
                    </mark>
                    For example, on my homepage, I have clear distinctions between this 
                    section where I am discussing my design rationale, and the section below
                    that has information about me. I made these distinctions by 
                    separating the content so that only one section displays on the 
                    screen at one time, and made the backgrounds of each section different.
                    I did this so that
                    <mark>
                        the readers are not bombarded with information and can easily 
                        focus on one section at a time.
                    </mark>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another design decision I made was to 
                    <mark>
                        bold and brighten the important text within sections. 
                    </mark>
                    I understand that HR representatives and engineers have a lot of work
                    to do, and maybe do not want to spend a long time reading paragraphs
                    of information. By highlighting the key text, 
                    <mark>
                        readers are able to skim the site and still get all necessary
                        information,
                    </mark>
                    and if they want to learn more, they can read the non highlighted 
                    text. I also broke up the text on the project pages into sections
                    with a heading for each so that the reader knows what information
                    they will learn before reading the text.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A majority of the design choices made for this website were 
                    decided on so that 
                    <mark>
                        potential employers could quickly gather as much information 
                        as they felt necessary,
                    </mark>
                    while also maintaining a simple and clean aesthetic design.
