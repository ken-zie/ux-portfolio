                <h2>UX 1400 Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this course, I have learned a lot about how users interact with 
                    products and how I should design these products with my end users in mind.
                    Before this course, I had an interest in art and design, but focused purely on 
                    aesthetics. This course taught me how I can 
                    <mark>
                        integrate usability into my designs to create products that 
                        are visually appealing, but can also be used efficiently and effectively
                        by users.
                    </mark>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I will admit, before taking this course, I did not see much value in a 
                    user experience education. I have always been interested in art as a hobby,
                    but have never really thought that design would be a useful skill to have 
                    in the engineering industry. However, 
                    <mark>
                        now that I have a better understanding of what user experience designers
                        do, I could not imagine my career being possible without them.
                    </mark>
                    I now realize that behind every piece of software, every website, and 
                    every tool that I use, someone had to think about how people would interact 
                    with the object and come up with a way to make the experience as smooth as 
                    possible. Not only will user experience professionals enable me to do my job as 
                    an engineer, but 
                    <mark>
                        they will also be necessary to ensure that the projects I work on are able 
                        to be used in the way I intend by customers.
                    </mark>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    User experience relates more to my major than I initially thought. As a mechanical
                    engineering and computer science student, I will likely be working on products or 
                    designs that will be used by customers such as mechanical parts or software 
                    applications. Therefore, 
                    <mark>
                        a background in user experience can be a very valuable tool for someone like 
                        me, so that when I'm designing, I can keep the client in mind 
                    </mark>
                    and think from their point of view to provide them with the best possible experience.
