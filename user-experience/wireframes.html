                            My main challenge with the wireframes was
                            <mark class = "secondary">having to think about the most logical way to 
                                display information without any styling.
                            </mark>
                            In the past, whenever I have created a design, I first thought about how I wanted it
                            to look and thought about layout after the fact. These wireframes forced me to think 
                            critically about how the user will gather information from the site. This way of thinking
                            was very different for me, which presented a lot of challenges, but proved to be useful.

                            One aspect of the wireframes that turned out well was the
                            <mark class = "secondary">hierarchy and emphasis of text.</mark>
                            When creating the wireframes, I tried to think about how to differentiate 
                            the important text from the rest since that was a problem I struggled with 
                            during the poster project. In the wireframes, 
                            <mark class = "secondary">I decided to show the important text by
                                making it larger. 
                            </mark> Not only did this help with information hierarchy, but it also helped 
                            add variation in the design, making it more appealing and interesting to 
                            look at.

                            One skill I improved upon throughout the creation of the wireframes was 
                            <mark class = "secondary">
                                critical thinking about how a user interacts with a site if the styling
                                has been removed. 
                            </mark>
                            As I said in the "Poster Summary" section, whenever designing, I always start 
                            out with a base design and from there, add my information. I very rarely have 
                            thought about where to put the information put before having a style or an 
                            aesthetic set in place. When creating the wireframes, I had to think about 
                            what I wanted the user to see first, what I wanted them to think was most 
                            important, and how I wanted to present them with the information. Therefore, 
                            when placing components in the wireframes, 
                            <mark class = "secondary">I thought about how to make the most
                            important text stand out, which pictures should be seen first and how they 
                            should relate to the text, and where to put the navigation so that the users
                            are able to navigate my site with ease.</mark>
                        </p>

                            Even though I improved in critical thinking about how users interact 
                            with my site, it is still an area that I can further improve on. In the future,
                            if I were to continue this project, I would
                            <mark class = "secondary">
                                make a list of all components I want to appear on the page, including 
                                headings, text, and pictures. From there, I would rank them in order of 
                                importance and group them together in a logical way. 
                            </mark>
                            I would use these lists and groupings then to help inform myself as to how 
                            I should place the components on the screen. However, I would probably do 
                            this after the drawn wireframes so that I still have some brainstormed ideas
                            of designs.
