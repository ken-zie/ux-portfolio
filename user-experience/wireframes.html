                            My main challenge with the wireframes was
                            <mark class = "secondary">having to think about the most logical way to 
                                display information without any styling.
                            </mark>
                            In the past, whenever I have created a design, I first thought about how I wanted it
                            to look and thought about layout after the fact. These wireframes forced me to think 
                            critically about how the user will gather information from the site. This way of thinking
                            was very different for me, which presented a lot of challenges, but proved to be useful.
