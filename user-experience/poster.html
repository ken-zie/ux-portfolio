                            The NASA RMC Lunabotics organization is
                            <mark class="secondary">engineering focused, and I wanted to portray that in the poster.</mark>
                            I did so by using a picture of a NASA Mars rover for the background, chose a simple and
                            straightforward
                            font, and made the separation lines resemble circuitry.

                            One skill I improved upon throuhgout the creation of this poster was
                            <mark class="secondary">information hierarchy.</mark>
                            My poster contains a lot of information because the organization has a general team meeting
                            and three subteam meetings, all of which have different meeting times. In my rough draft,
                            it took a lot of time to pick out what the most important information was. In the second
                            version,
                            <mark class="secondary">I placed more emphasis on the full team meeting by making it larger and
                                separating it from the subteam meetings.
                            </mark>
                            The second version was then reviewed by my peers, and each one said I might benefit from
                            including
                            an eye catching color. I then decided to
                            <mark class="secondary">place even more emphasis on the full team meeting by making it
                                green</mark>
                            so that if someone were to glance at the poster, thier eyes would first go to the large title,
                            and
                            then to the brightly colored full team meeting.
                            <mark class="secondary">I wanted to highlight the title and the full team meeting because
                                they are most important.

                            When designing, I tend to make the designs busy because I like a more cluttered aesthetic.
                            However, this makes it very hard for users to quickly and easily find important information.
                            I noticed this when I was creating the poster because I had a tendency to include lots of
                            unnecessary information, simply for aesthetic purposes. Therefore,
                            <mark class="secondary">for all my upcoming projets, I would like to improve by
